**Data Cleaning and Analysis in R - README**

This repository contains the R code and cleaned dataset for the data cleaning and analysis project. The project focuses on cleaning and analyzing sales data related to vast amounts of agricultural land in less developed countries, obtained from the GRAIN organization. The data is provided in an Excel file, with two sheets in the workbook.

**Project Overview**

The main objective of this project is to retrieve, load, and clean the data using R, ensuring it is ready for analysis. The data may contain errors in formatting, spelling, missing values, data types, outliers, etc. The project involves the following tasks:

1. Retrieve and load the data from the Excel file.
2. Combine the data from both sheets into one dataset.
3. Perform data cleaning, including handling missing values, correcting errors, converting data types, and removing outliers.
4. Create visualizations (histograms, boxplots, graphs, etc.) for at least two variables to aid in the identification of errors and data exploration.
5. Save the cleaned dataset as a new Excel file.


**Getting Started**

To replicate the data cleaning and analysis process, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have R and the required packages installed, including readxl and tidyverse, using the following commands:

install.packages("readxl")
install.packages("tidyverse")

2. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
3. Open the R script file (data_cleaning_analysis.R) in your preferred R editor or IDE.
4. Set the appropriate file path for the Excel dataset (GRAIN---Land-grab-deals---Jan-2012-2.xlsx) in the R script.
5. Run the R script, which will perform the data cleaning and analysis steps outlined above.
6. Once the script finishes executing, the cleaned dataset will be saved as a new Excel file (cleaned_data.xlsx) in the specified directory.
7. You can explore the visualizations generated by the script and analyze the cleaned dataset for further insights.

**Repository Structure**

The repository includes the following files:

**data_cleaning_analysis.R**: The R script containing the code for data cleaning and analysis.
**GRAIN---Land-grab-deals---Jan-2012-2.xlsx:** The original Excel dataset with two sheets.
**cleaned_data.xlsx:** The cleaned dataset is saved as an Excel file.
**README.md:** The ReadMe file provides an overview of the project and instructions.

**Notes and Considerations**

Make sure to adjust the file paths in the R script to match the location of the Excel dataset on your machine.
The data cleaning process may require customization based on the specific errors and anomalies present in the dataset.
Justifications for handling missing data, outliers, errors, and other issues can be found in the code comments throughout the R script.
